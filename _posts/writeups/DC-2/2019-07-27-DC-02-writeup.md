Hello guys, it is Shin today been a while that we have posted a post in our blog but we swear we will try to post more in the future so anyways today we will guide you in rooting DC-02 made by DCAU.

# Recon
Firstly, let's find the ip of the machine by doing:
``` sudo netdiscover -r ip/24 ```

![](/img/vulnhub/dc-2/netdiscover)
<br>after finding the ip of the machine you can now do your attacks and don't forget to edit your /etc/hosts to add dc-2. </br>
## nmap
```
Nmap scan report for dc-2 (192.168.0.131)
Host is up (0.0084s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp   open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.10 ((Debian))
7744/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 6.7p1 Debian 5+deb8u7 (protocol 2.0)

```
# HTTP
Visiting the website gave me this good look and it seems to be a wordpress site so I decided to use wpscan.

Going to the flag option in the menubar , we got a good hint for us to move ahead.

## WPSCAN
By using wpscan we can see the vulnerable parts of the wordpress site and the one thing that really caught my attention was the xmlrpc

<br>After I did some asking around with my peers they told me that you can try and bruteforce xmlrpc by doing a certain command.</br>
### Users
first we enumerate the users by using this command:
<br>```wp scan --url http://dc-2/  -e u```

I found three usernames : admin, jerry and tom as the hint said we have to generate our own custom wordlist so I decided to use cewl to generate it 

```cewl http://dc-2/ -w password```

We have now a dictionary for passwords and 3 multiple users that we can use for bruteforcing, now !let's try to bruteforce the website using wpscan:

#### Sucess:
```
 Valid Combinations Found:
 | Username: jerry, Password: adipiscing
 | Username: tom, Password: parturient
```
After getting the credentials, I have tried to login to each account to make sure I don't miss something and there it was we have found the flag 2:
![screenshot of flag2](/img/vulnhub/dc-2/flag2.png)
# Root
Since the clue was telling us to find another entry point  to reach our final flag, I suddenly tried to login through ssh using Tom's credentials and it worked but unfortunately we were put in a restricted shell and so I found out that I can use vi in the restricted shell so I used it to escape the shell.

![rbash](/img/vulnhub/dc-2/rbash.png)
<br>After escaping the restricted shell, we have to export “/bin/bash” as our SHELL environment variable and “/usr/bin” as  our PATH environment variable so that we can run Linux commands  properly by doing the command below:
<br>```export PATH=$PATH:/bin:/usr/bin```

<br>Now we can read the flag and have a functional linux commands.
By reading the flag3 it's already telling us to change user to Jerry.

```Poor old Tom is always running after Jerry. Perhaps he should su for all the stress he causes.```

Reading the flag 4 in Jerry's directory and checking Jerry's permission is already telling my senses that to gain root we have to use git.
![flag4](/img/vulnhub/dc-2/flag4.png)

By checking [GTFOBINS](https://gtfobins.github.io/) I can really say I am in the right path to root the machine.
Yep this looks promising!

```
sudo git -p help config
!/bin/sh
```
Let's try it!

![root](/img/vulnhub/dc-2/root.png)

BOOM! and we are root everyone

![flag](/img/vulnhub/dc-2/final-flag.png)

And that's how you root DC-2 guys, it was fun learning some things especially escaping the rbash and it was my first time using gtfobins to gain root and I really do recommend to take a look at it. 
Good luck everyone!
